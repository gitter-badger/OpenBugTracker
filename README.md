Slow development rate
-
Hey there,<br>
I'm sorry to say but the development rate of OpenProjectManager will slow dramatically, since I'm about to start the second semester of my graduation.

Welcome to OpenProjectManager.
-
<p>OpenProjectManager is built on top of the powerful PostgreSQL, and for now the only way to use OBT is using the web front-end, but in the future you will be able to use OpenBugTrakcer from you desktop.</p>

<p>At the beginning, OpenProjectManager was a trivial project but after some months of coding and coffee, the goal of the project changed and now it's to give the best experience to the users and the teams behind the projects in a worldwide way.</p>

<p>Whether is a small team or a large company, OpenProjectManager will fit your need's and help build better software. With full Git support, you can see all the changes, log's, current work and even push things to a git repository, awesome right??</p>
